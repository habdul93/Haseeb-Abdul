        Third-party applications have become an essential component of modern ecosystems such as Android and Facebook. These applications can be: web-based, desktop-based, or mobile-device-based applications. The number of third-party applications has grown tremendously in recent years, for instance, the average number of applications installed on Facebook each day is 20 million, and the number of Android applications in the market is 1.8 million. Although these applications provide users with better and more customized experience, they may also cause security and privacy risks. In most cases, third-party applications need to access restricted resources on these platforms, thus, platform providers have deployed access control mechanisms to control the privileges these applications can obtain. Nonetheless, malicious applications continue to find their ways to gain privileged access to users’ data and profiles. The success of these malicious attacks depends largely on the efficiency of the access control mechanisms and users’ awareness and comprehension.  My research investigates the security and privacy risks of third-party applications by analyzing the access control mechanisms, finding possible vulnerabilities, implementing countermeasures, and studying users’ awareness and comprehension to the vulnerabilities and the countermeasures.

                                                    As part of the OAuth implementation, these applications must either have access to the system browser, or they must have a browser embedded as a web view. In Android, the embedded browser is called WebView. Previous researches have discussed the risk of using WebView and its APIs on web’s security in general. The focus of our research is on risks pertaining to using WebView as part of OAuth implementations. In fact, using the WebView as part of OAuth implementations in mobile applications is unsafe and prone to many attacks.  Our research efforts has resulted in identifying various kinds of OAuth-based attacks against WebView and native browser approaches [P5]. Our research started by analyzing different OAuth implementations adopted by the SDKs of the popular resource providers on mobile devices and showed that most of them are vulnerable to numerous kind of attacks [P5].  The OAuth standard recognizes three parties: the resource owner, the resource provider (e.g. Facebook), and the client application. In the situation when the client application is a mobile app a fourth party comes into play which is the operating system. Such a situation makes it difficult for the user to comprehend the role of each party which could lead into compromising his/her privacy. To test the aforementioned hypothesis, we have conducted a user study to evaluate users’ separation understanding between the mobile app context and provider context, in cases where the mobile apps communicate with online service providers (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Dropbox) [S1].

                                                    The separation includes the authorization page’s contents and the data being entered (e.g. credentials). Our user study results showed that smartphone’s users lack the separation awareness between mobile apps and service providers. The lack of understanding could lead into trusting a malicious content that could result in compromising users’ privacy. Based on our previous findings we realize that there is a necessity to harden OAuth-WebView against the recognized attacks. We first started by looking at stand-alone application-based solutions to the OAuth vulnerabilities in which a secure WebView is implemented in a separate application to provide a secure OAuth flow in smartphones. The solution is based on the concept of privilege separation and does not require high overhead [P2]. The solution requires that both developers and service providers to change their implementations to work with the proposed solution. A second solution is proposed but this time it does not require any changes to be made by the developers and the service providers. The proposed OAuth protection framework for the Android platform [S1] is composed of: Android library modifications, service creation, and system app creation. The framework hardens the OAuth-WebView implementations with an acceptable processing overhead and a minimum memory overhead; moreover, it does not require high user involvement.

The suggested search engine matches the user query with the descriptions of the apps (unlike the current search engine that matches them with the title of the apps) to retrieve the most relevant apps and then re-rank them based on their security configurations. The advantage of this approach is that it does not count on users’ awareness and attention, which was proven to be very weak. Moreover, our approach is going to push applications developer towards asking for minimum permissions possible to guarantee high rankings for their apps. Reducing the number of permissions would definitely reduce the attack surface.

                                                            In this project, we propose to build a secure search engine for Android third-party applications to aid users install the least intrusive applications. The suggested search engine matches the user query with the descriptions of the apps (unlike the current search engine that matches them with the title of the apps) to retrieve the most relevant apps and then re-rank them based on their security configurations. The advantage of this approach is that it does not count on users’ awareness and attention, which was proven to be very weak. Moreover, our approach is going to push applications developer towards asking for minimum permissions possible to guarantee high rankings for their apps. Reducing the number of permissions would definitely reduce the attack surface.

Upon installing a new Android application, a user is prompted to grant it a set of permissions. There are two typical assumptions made regarding permissions and mobile application security and privacy. The first one is that malicious applications need to retain much permission. Secondly, mobile devices users assume that installed applications do not access data if they are not in the foreground. In this project, we showed that malicious Android applications can still fulfill their objectives with minimum permissions and that they can access user data while in the background. This could happen with the help of another Android component, called broadcast receiver [P1]. We studied the evaluation of Android broadcast actions. We demonstrated an attack scenario made possible by the broadcast receivers. Moreover, we developed an app to aid user identify the broadcasts receivers that are registered by the apps on their own Android devices called Broadcasts Viewer.
