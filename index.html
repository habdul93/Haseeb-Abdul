                <p class="text-justify">The app displays all statically registered Broadcast receivers. Broadcast receivers are messages been sent by the system to any application that request to receive them. There are two ways to register a receiver: statically and dynamically. The dynamic registration enable an app to receive system broadcasts while on the foreground and user present. Static registration on the other hand allows applications to receive system broadcasts regardless of being on the foreground or not. This feature may pose security threat as well as a performance issues to your device.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fadi-Mohsen-Broadcasts-Viewer/dp/B00U6ALGPW" class="btn btn-danger">View</a>

                <h3>UROP PROJECT #UR329</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">An Android application is composed of one or more of the following components: activity, service, content provider, and broadcast receiver. The Broadcast receivers are used as a mean of communication between app’s components, between different apps, and between the OS and apps. The later enables applications to register for system events or actions (e.g. receive call, receive message). Once an event occurs, Android run-time notifies all applications that have a registered receivers of that particular action. The Android system delivers numerous broadcasts for system events, such as when an Internet connection is enabled or a new SMS arrives.</p><a href=" https://www.umflint.edu/research/urop-project-ur329" class="btn btn-danger">View</a>

                                    <p class="text-justify">Android provides finer-grained security features through a ”permission” mechanism that puts limitations on the resources that each application can access. Upon installing a new Android application, a user is prompted to grant it a set of permissions. There are two typical assumptions made regarding permissions and mobile application security and privacy. The first one is that malicious applications need to retain much permission. Secondly, mobile devices users assume that installed applications do not access data if they are not in the foreground. In this project, we showed that malicious Android applications can still fulfill their objectives with minimum permissions and that they can access user data while in the background. This could happen with the help of another Android component, called broadcast receiver [P1]. We studied the evaluation of Android broadcast actions. We demonstrated an attack scenario made possible by the broadcast receivers. Moreover, we developed an app to aid user identify the broadcasts receivers that are registered by the apps on their own Android devices called Broadcasts Viewer.

                                <p class="text-justify">Android has a large share in the mobile apps market which makes it attractive for both malicious and good developers. Online apps markets, despite their vetting procedures, still admit malicious apps that could be downloaded mistakenly by mobile users. Detecting Android malwares has been studied by many researchers using different approaches and techniques. The vast majority of them though were focused on using the requested permissions that are declared in the AndroidManifest. xml files. A number of researchers have considered other components of the Android applications besides the permissions such as package info, activities, and process name. Some researchers pointed out Android Broadcast receivers' component but it was not discussed thoroughly like other components. In this paper, we are conducting an empirical study to investigate the usage patterns of …</p>
